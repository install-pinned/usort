Securely install the latest [usort](https://pypi.org/project/usort/) release from PyPI.

This action installs a pinned version of **usort** and all its dependencies,         making sure that file hashes match. Pinning your dependencies stops supply chain attacks where an adversary         replaces usort or one of its dependencies with malicious code.

## Usage

In your GitHub Actions workflow, use this action like so:

```yaml
- name: Install usort from PyPI
  uses: install-pinned/usort@5c15517953f82b82587e25c222f6b5c669ddda3f  # 1.0.5
```

## Alternatives

This action is a relatively simple wrapper around the fantastic [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.rtfd.io)         and is most useful if there is no existing `requirements.txt`/`poetry.lock`/... infrastructure in place.         If you already pin all your dependencies in a single place, you don't need it!
